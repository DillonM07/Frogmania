<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



Frogmania is a game about forming your frog empire! You and your loyal subjects will assimilate more and more frogs, eventually making it a streamline production of brilliance! Tap Tap Tap away and build up your own frog regime! Dedicated to my younger brother Riker, the frog loving crazed six year old!

About Me:
I started making this game on 11/31/21 on the day after my 14TH birthday and since then it has come a long way, the first release being just the day after, 12/01/21 12:58 PM, with a couple buttons and some very primative coding. Since then I have expanded my CSS capabilites and learned a lot, I even had a day where I was at almost four hundred veiws a couple hours after my fourth pre-alpha release on Version 1.0.4 Patch Notes 12/07/21 at 8:57 AM! I hope to grow as a developer and learn a lot, don't be scarce to tell what would make it a nicer experience! I still have a long way to go until Beta but I hope with some helping hands it could be sooner! - Your Croakin' Dev, Dillon Mowry

###Full Alpha Testing Soon, Hopefully
